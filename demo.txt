til: A Forest Path
con:
+ You are walking down a path through a forest. An endless orchestra of whispering trees and chirping birds play around you. The sun had already dipped below the mountains and the night rolls over the sky.
+ You are a hunter. The townsfolk tell of a beast that roams the woods at night. Perhaps you could hunt it.
+ You stop at an intersection of forked pathways. The path on the right winds up a hill. The path on the left curves down to where a lake lies.

+ #[Walk to the lake>2]
+ #[Walk up the hill>3]

til: Along the Lakeside
con:
+ You continue walking along the side of the lake. The water is calm. A chorus of crickets chime in with the beats of your footsteps. An owl hoots from somewhere in the dark trees.
+ Suddenly, you hear something speed through the nearby bushes. You instinctively ready your bow and arrow. You hear it again. It sounds like its coming towards you.
