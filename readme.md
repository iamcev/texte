Texte is a tool for writing text-based games. Basically you write out your game on a text file and Texte will parse it and generate the game for you.

Texte is a fork of and inspired by [Visor](https://github.com/v-exec/Visor) by @v-exec, renders presentations from text files.

Texte is currently in development.
