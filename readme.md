Texte is a tool for writing text-based games. Basically you write out your game on a text file and Texte will parse it and generate the game for you.

Texte is a fork of and inspired by [Visor](https://github.com/v-exec/Visor) by @v-exec, which renders presentations from text files.

Texte is currently in development.

## Planned Features

- Gradient backgrounds
- Transitions between pages (fade)
- Boolean flags to keep track of things (like if an item is equipped)
- More layout options
- More typography options (sans, serif, mono, cursive)
- Declare variables in .txt file (could be used for things like coin counters or hp/xp bars)
- A simpler way of writing. Less formatting rules, more writing

## Demo
